Switch the taxonomy for all terms or only child terms of a specified parent term.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to select your "From", and "To" Taxonomies, to convert all terms. Optionally select a parent term to limit terms to switch. Typing term names will do a live search of terms with the name you are typing AND possess child terms.

Plugin also has built-in support for [WP-CLI](http://wp-cli.org/). In the command line, type in `wp taxonomy-switcher` for instructions.

[Plugin is on GitHub](https://github.com/WebDevStudios/taxonomy-switcher). Pull Requests and Forks welcome.

### Notes

Please keep in mind, if parent isn't set, or you don't specify a comma-separated list of term ids to migrate, it will migrate *all* terms for that taxonomy to the new taxonomy.
